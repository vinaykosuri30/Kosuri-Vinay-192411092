int main() 
{ 
    int a,b,sum; 
    printf("No.of passengers in the bus ="); 
    scanf("%d",&a); 
    printf("No.of passengers got on to the bus in the next stop="); 
    scanf("%d",&b); 
    sum=a+b; 
    printf("Now total no.of passengers in the bus =%d",sum); 
     return 0; 
} 


3) A library has 345 fiction books and 278 non-fiction books. How many books are there in total ?

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b,sum;
    printf("No.of fiction books in the library =");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("No.of non-fiction books in the library =");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    sum =a+b;
    printf("Total no.of books present in the library is %d",sum);
    return 0;
}


4) Write a c program that takes the birth years of 2 people as input and calculates the age difference between them using arithemetic operators.
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a,b,agedifference;
    printf("Age of 1st boy is ");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Age of 2nd boy is ");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    agedifference = a-b;
    if (agedifference<0){
        agedifference = -agedifference;
    }
    printf("Age difference between two boys is %d years",agedifference);
    return 0;
}


5) Write a C program that takes the length and breadth of a rectangle as input and calculate its area and perimeter using arithmetic operators. 
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a,b,area,perimeter;
    printf("Length of rectangle is ");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Breadth of rectangle is ");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    area = a*b;
    perimeter = 2*(a+b);
    printf("Area of the rectangle is %d and perimeter is %d",area,perimeter);
    return 0;
}   


6) Write a C program that takes the principal amount rate of interest, and time in years as input and calculates the simple interest using arithmetic operatiors.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float principal, rate, time, simpleInterest;
    printf("Enter the principal amount: ");
    scanf("%f", &principal);
    printf("Enter the rate of interest: ");
    scanf("%f", &rate);
    printf("Enter the time in years: ");
    scanf("%f", &time);
    simpleInterest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
    printf("Simple Interest: %.2f\n", simpleInterest);
    return 0;
}


7) Write a C program that takes two numbers input and calculates the quotient and remainder using division modulus operators.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int dividend, divisor, remainder;
    float quotient;
    printf("Enter the dividend: ");
    scanf("%d", &dividend);

    printf("Enter the divisor: ");
    scanf("%d", &divisor);

   quotient = dividend / divisor;
   remainder = dividend % divisor;
   printf("Quotient of two numbers is %.2f and remainder is %d",quotient,remainder);

    return 0;
}


8) Imagine you're at a provision store, and you need to buy different products like rice, sugar, and oil. Each product has a price and quantity, and the store applies a 5% tax on the total purchase.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float rice_cost,sugar_cost,oil_cost,rice_qty,sugar_qty,oil_qty;
    float Tax = 0.05; 
    printf("Enter the rice cost = ");
    scanf("%f",&rice_cost);
    printf("Enter the sugar cost = ");
    scanf("%f",&sugar_cost);
    printf("Enter the oil cost = ");
    scanf("%f",&oil_cost);
    printf("Quantity of rice in kgs = ");
    scanf("%f",&rice_qty);
    printf("Quantity of sugar in kgs = ");
    scanf("%f",&sugar_qty);
    printf("Quantity of oil in ltrs = ");
    scanf("%f",&oil_qty);
    float sub_total = (rice_cost*rice_qty)+(sugar_cost*sugar_qty)+(oil_cost*oil_qty);
    float total_tax = sub_total*Tax;
    float total_cost = sub_total + total_tax;
    printf("Total cost of all item is %f rupess\n",sub_total);
    printf("Total cost of all items with 5% Tax is %.3frupees",total_cost);
    return 0;   
}
