1)There are 15 chairs in one row and 18 chairs in another row. How many chairs are there in total ?
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b,sum;
    printf("No.of chairs in 1 row =");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("No.of chairs in another row =");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    sum=a+b;
    printf("Total No.of chairs =%d",sum);
    return 0;
}


2) There were 23 passengers on a bus. At the next stop, 12 more passengers are now on the bus?
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    int a,b,sum; 
    printf("No.of passengers in the bus ="); 
    scanf("%d",&a); 
    printf("No.of passengers got on to the bus in the next stop="); 
    scanf("%d",&b); 
    sum=a+b; 
    printf("Now total no.of passengers in the bus =%d",sum); 
     return 0; 
} 


3) A library has 345 fiction books and 278 non-fiction books. How many books are there in total ?

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b,sum;
    printf("No.of fiction books in the library =");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("No.of non-fiction books in the library =");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    sum =a+b;
    printf("Total no.of books present in the library is %d",sum);
    return 0;
}


4) Write a c program that takes the birth years of 2 people as input and calculates the age difference between them using arithemetic operators.
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a,b,agedifference;
    printf("Age of 1st boy is ");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Age of 2nd boy is ");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    agedifference = a-b;
    if (agedifference<0){
        agedifference = -agedifference;
    }
    printf("Age difference between two boys is %d years",agedifference);
    return 0;
}


5) Write a C program that takes the length and breadth of a rectangle as input and calculate its area and perimeter using arithmetic operators. 
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a,b,area,perimeter;
    printf("Length of rectangle is ");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Breadth of rectangle is ");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    area = a*b;
    perimeter = 2*(a+b);
    printf("Area of the rectangle is %d and perimeter is %d",area,perimeter);
    return 0;
}   


6) Write a C program that takes the principal amount rate of interest, and time in years as input and calculates the simple interest using arithmetic operatiors.

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float principal, rate, time, simpleInterest;
    printf("Enter the principal amount: ");
    scanf("%f", &principal);
    printf("Enter the rate of interest: ");
    scanf("%f", &rate);
    printf("Enter the time in years: ");
    scanf("%f", &time);
    simpleInterest = (principal * rate * time) / 100;
    printf("Simple Interest: %.2f\n", simpleInterest);
    return 0;
}
